[√] get all heroes that match with the given name  
[√] update a hero  
[√] delete a hero  
[√] create a hero  
[√] create unit tests for this service  

Create a component which will be able to:

[√] show a paginated list of heroes where will appear two buttons with the text "Editar" and "Borrar"  
[√] show an input for searching heroes by the given text  
[√] show an empty form when pressing "Añadir"  
[√] show confirmation dialog when user clicks on "Borrar"  
[√] delete hero when user clicks on "Borrar" inside the dialog  
[√] create unit tests for this component  

Addionataly:

[√] Information should be stored inside service  
[√] use good practices  
[√] use angular material

[√] use a directive to make edit field value uppercase (used scss instead)  
[] use mockserver somehow  
[√] communication between components  
[√] use reactive programming  
[√] use lambdas
